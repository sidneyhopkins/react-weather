# React Weather

#### By Sidney Hopkins

#### Type a city name and receive weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (Styled-Components, Material-UI)

## Description

This application allows users to type a city name and generates the date and local weather data. I've removed my API key for security, but you are welcome to clone the project and add your own API key (link below). Down the road, I would love to create a true backend and avoid this workaround.

https://openweathermap.org/api

## How to use

- Clone this repository to your desktop
- Open the folder in your code editor
- Paste your personal API key (from https://openweathermap.org/api) into the indicated space at the top of src/App.jsx
- Navigate to the top level of the directory
- Run **npm start** in the command line
